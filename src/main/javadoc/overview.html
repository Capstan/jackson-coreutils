    <title>JSON core utilities for Jackson</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>What this is</h1>

<p>This package provides the following utilities over Jackson (2.1.x):</p>

<ul>
    <li>an {@link com.google.common.base.Equivalence} over {@link
    com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode} for numeric JSON values;</li>
    <li>a generalized <a
    href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-appsawg-json-pointer-09">JSON
    pointer</a> implementation over Jackson's {@link
    com.fasterxml.jackson.core.TreeNode};</li>
    <li>a JSON Pointer implementation for {@link
    com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}.</li>
</ul>

<h1>JSON numeric equivalence</h1>

<p>Several proposed IETF drafts require that two JSON numeric values be
considered equal if their mathematical value is equal. Among these are JSON
Schema and JSON Patch. But this is not the case with {@link
com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}: <span style="font-family: monospace">1
</span> and <span style="font-family: monospace">1.0</span> yield different
types of nodes.</p>

<p>This package provides an {@link com.google.common.base.Equivalence} to
ensure that two numeric nodes are considered equivalent if their mathematical
value is the same. See the javadoc for more information on how to use it.</p>

<h1>JSON Pointer</h1>

<p>JSON Pointer is an IETF draft which allows to unambiguously address a single
value in a JSON document. This package contains an implementation which can not
only address nodes in a {@link com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonNode}, but any
{@link com.fasterxml.jackson.core.TreeNode} implementation.</p>

<p>All JSON Pointer related classes are in the following package: {@link
com.github.fge.jackson.jsonpointer}.</p>
